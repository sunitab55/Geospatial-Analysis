I pondered about the EV vehicles that drive past me everyday. I wanted to know if the people in EV cars were really driving clean. I went into deep dive about how the EV stations across the United States source their energy! Is it solar, wind, biofuel? Could they also be sourcing from fossil fuels?
Hence I created a projec to understand how far we may have come on our journey to being clean! I dive into each states stations and compare how they are sourcing their energies!
